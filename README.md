# Belly-button Challenge
This repository contains my homework for Module 14.

For this assignment, I have been asked to create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (see Resources folder). This dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize the human navel. 

## Content
In this repository, you will find:

- Images folder: containing the example images provided for the assignment;
- StarterCode folder: containing the index.html file, samples.json file and in the static/js folder, in the app.js file, the code I have written for this assignment; 
- Data folder: contain again the samples.json file. 

## Result
Please see below a screenshot of the dashboard I have built.
